-bug:
    -when you click any button in the navbar, the margin-top
    setting of the jumbotron class is reset to zero
    this should be a quick monkey-patch but it isn't:
        $(".jumbotron").css("margin-top", 69);




-convert banner to hd image slideshow 
    X-put at least two hd pictures in slider
    X-make slider full width of screen on any screensize
    -put links in captions (link to "lookbook" like on tankfarm site)
    
-make lookbook of flowers
    -lookbook should end with Britt's bouquet of white roses
    
X-put "Debbie's Den" in a logo, and put logo in navbar


-a dozen white roses (my fiancee's favorite), with two-tone leaves and stems of
all three of her favorite colors, (green, blue and pink)

---  <p>Handcrafted gifts and trinkets</p> 







-make site responsive (make 'about' and 'products' sections 
scale larger at larger screensizes like top banner does)
    -build 3 independent stylesheets (mobile, tablet, desktop)
        -establish breakpoints using media queries to enclose each stylesheet
        -clean up code to only include styles for that breakpoint
        
    -include links to all 3 stylesheets in index.html
    -start at mobile, then establish breakpoints
    
    
    
    
    
-flavor text under product categories is too close to the next category,
and too far away from it's own category; fix the margins

-set up form element for emailing myself



-create IA, then use that to build site's design
    - include everything you want in the site in the IA
    -

X-create logo
-run "Debbie's Den" by mum, Forever Flowers is pretty taken

-look into URLs, then head over to Cloud Flare for the 
security stuff
