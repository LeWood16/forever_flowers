scale larger at larger screensizes like top banner does)
    -build 3 independent stylesheets (mobile, tablet, desktop)
        -establish breakpoints using media queries to enclose each stylesheet
        -clean up code to only include styles for that breakpoint
        
    -include links to all 3 stylesheets in index.html
    -start at mobile, then establish breakpoints
